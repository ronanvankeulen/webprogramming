# Webprogramming Overview
These designs were created during my course Commercial Economics - Digital Business Concepts during the Graduation Course Web Programming. All these designs were made during the period the course was taught, namely from November 2023 to January 2024. 

For this, I was able to experiment with how GSAP and JS work, besides refreshing my pre-existing knowledge about HTML and CSS. To master this code language, I created GSAP animations for the company I work for, LORI-LORI. I have often done this through tutorials, which are linked to each project in the description below.

You can copy both the HTML and the CSS page and experiment with it, pasting it into index.html and main.css docs in Visual Studio Code.  Feel free to play with values, to put your own spin on it. Don't forget to copy the GSAP/JS CDN's from the HTML page, otherwhise the animations won't work.

# Oefen_doc_1 exaplantion
This was my first encounter with JavaScript during one of the classes of the Graduation Course Webprogramming. In this, we were able to practice with the basics of JavaScript. In this case, it made it clear how we could set what a response would be when someone clicked the button. 

# Oefen_doc_2 exaplantion
This was my second encounter with JavaScript during one of the classes of the Graduation Course Webprogramming. In this, we were able to practice with the basics of JavaScript. In this case, it showed us how to animate texts. We did this by adding different animations on the texts such as bounce effects and horizontal slide in effects.

# Doc_3_LORI_title exaplantion
This was one of my first times I tried making something myself by following this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=va1RrFr-gms. For this project, I tried to make a Split Text animation. 

# Doc_4_Spotlight exaplantion
When I started to understand a bit more how GSAP and JS work, I tried to redo a more challenging tutorial, with a cut out/ clip path effect. Here is the tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6z8MYjZ_J8&t=1s

# Doc_5_LORI_home exaplantion
This is one of the bigger projects I did. I tried to rebuild the first home screen of the LORI-LORI website, and add animations to it. This was a bit more challenging and required lots of coding. To redo the website, I have watched many tutorials my school offered on how to code again with HTML/CSS. Also I followed tutorials on how to make a marquee (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOkPZOEIAh4) and a custom cursor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfpRZ2t_BrQ&t=377s). 

# Doc_6_Product_page exaplantion
For this project I tried to make a cool and inspiring product page with a floating product image for LORI-LORI, which is really different than the one the webshop has now. It is cool to try out some new layouts. To do so, I used this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzM1hIOkPhM&t=68s. For all tutorials, I tried to type it myself and then change things to make it a LORI-LORI feeling. 

# Doc_7_Photo_slider exaplantion
For this project, I copied a tutorial style from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uX0JyE77dKs and adjusted and added more animations. You can see text animations, photos sliding in and out and and overlay effect. 

# Doc_8_Fail exaplantion
During this course I really tried to follow a lot of tutorials. However, a lot of tutorials missed essential information for the project to succeed. This is an example of a project that failed, cause the tutorial didn't show well how the text on the image hover can be aligned and sized well. Even though the project didn't succeed, all these tutorials cost me a lot of time and therefore I thought it was good to still show this project as an example. Tutorial used: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZQnqBj_Oi4&t=241s.

# Doc_9_Cursor exaplantion
This document is the same as doc 5, I only wanted to try out a custom cursor with a image. That's what I tried here. I used the same tutorial as in doc 5 for this (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfpRZ2t_BrQ&t=377s).
